# Bioinformatics-Assignment-Toolkit

The project includes various bioinformatics tasks such as DNA sequence processing, protein classification, and clustering based on amino acid usage. Each task is broken down into functions designed to solve specific problems related to genomics and proteomics.

# Features
- Developed methods to read DNA sequences, extract primers, and calculate melting temperatures.
- Translated DNA sequences into proteins, identified open reading frames, and wrote results in FASTA format.
- Analyzed amino acid sequences, calculated residue percentages, and processed multiple sequences for comparison.
- Calculated Euclidean distances between proteins based on amino acid properties and generated a distance matrix for clustering.
