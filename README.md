# dna-protein-seq-functions

This repository contains a collection of Python functions designed for DNA and protein sequence analysis. These functions allow you to process DNA sequences, compute primers, calculate melting temperatures, and analyze amino acid sequences.

# Features
- Developed methods to read DNA sequences, extract primers, and calculate melting temperatures.
- Translated DNA sequences into proteins, identified open reading frames, and wrote results in FASTA format.
- Analyzed amino acid sequences, calculated residue percentages, and processed multiple sequences for comparison.
- Calculated Euclidean distances between proteins based on amino acid properties and generated a distance matrix for clustering.

# Installation
